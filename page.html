                    <h3>Charcoal</h3>
                    <p>A charcoal grill is easy to use, and foodies crave the smoky, rich flavor which charcoal imparts.
                    <br>
                    <br>All charcoal grills operate with a few basic similarities. Air intake is located toward the bottom of the grill and is adjusted manually. When air comes into the grill, it passes by the lit charcoal and exits through an additional vent at the top of the grill, similar to a wood-burning stove. The more air that’s allowed to enter and exit the grill, the hotter the grill will get.
                    <br>
                    <br>One of the benefits of being able to adjust the air intake and exhaust is that once the temperature stabilizes within the temperature zone you wish to cook, it typically remains constant and consistent throughout the cooking process, provided there is enough charcoal to keep it running at that temperature.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This is particularly beneficial when cooking tougher cuts of meat for extended periods of time, which allows them to break down into tender meat with extremely pronounced flavors.

                    <h3>Pellet</h3>
                    <p>Although pellet grills have been out for about 30 years now, they have become a hot item in grilling over the past 5 years as a convenient and flavorful option. One of the most appealing things about the pellet grill is that it truly acts as both a smoker and a grill, making the hybrid of the two a fantastic selling feature.
                    <br>
                    <br>Food-quality wood pellets about the size of a black-eyed pea are loaded into a hopper and are delivered to a burn pot with an auger. Depending on what temperature you set your grill, the thermostat and burn pot work electronically to keep the grill close to your desired temperature. Because the electronic temperature controls are always adjusting to keep the grill within your specified range, there aren’t many adjustments to make once you get the cooker operating to your specifications.
                    <br>
                    <br>This is convenient, especially with longer cooks like brisket, ribs, and large roasts, allowing that you let the meat cook without too much monitoring. Because of the electronic settings, this type of grill does require a power source which must be connected throughout the entire cook and cool-down process.
                    <br>
                    <br>Pellet grills have had a reputation for not searing or browning meat as effectively as other grills, but some manufacturers have made great strides in changing the perception of pellet grills and are showcasing recipes with amazing char and grill marks.

                    <h3>Gas</h3>
                    <p>The Hearth Patio and Barbecue Association (HPBA) estimates that 72% of US households have a grill and more than 200 million people can enjoy outdoor cooking. Natural gas and propane grills make up the majority of these grills and there are many styles to choose from.
                    <br>
                    <br>Gas and propane grills all operate similarly, with burners typically emitting around 40,000 BTUs of heat, firing on three, four, or more burners to cook your food from below with either direct or indirect heat.
                    <br>
                    <br>Part of the appeal of gas grills is that they are convenient, they heat up fast, and there are many accessory options available to enhance the cooking experience. Accessories such as side burners, lights, integrated food thermometers, and dedicated meat searing areas combine gadgets and gimmicks, and the industry is always adding new innovations.
                    <br>
                    <br> Gas grills, like gas stoves, are instantly on and require the shortest amount of pre-heating before you can start grilling. This is convenient, but gas burns very clean and will add little additional flavor compared to charcoal or pellet grills.
